Read ${SPEC_PATH} from 00_START_HERE.md (look for "SPEC_PATH:" at the top).

If design system is needed, open ${SPEC_PATH}06_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md and draft:

- Color palette rules
- Typography scale
- Spacing scale
- Component patterns
- Interaction states
- Dark/light mode rules (if applicable)

Present 2–3 design system directions and recommend one.
Optionally generate 06A_DESIGN_TOKENS.json from chosen direction.
Ask ONE blocking question.
No app code changes.

**NEXT STEP**: When 06_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md is complete and approved, run `full-app-07-security-nfr-tdd.md` to define security and non-functional requirements.
